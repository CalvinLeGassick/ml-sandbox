# ml-sandbox
Playing with fundamental ML algorithms from scratch on some data sets.

For now, the code here is just pumped out implementations to get a feel for the algorithms. Next step is to clean up and comment the code here on my own, and then to compare to other implementations to get insights on best practices.

Must have `python 2.7.x` and `numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib` installed to run code in these directories.

TODO:
- Upload HMM and MDP code to GitHub. 
- Implement some raw NN code.
- Start 'cleanup' and 'documentation' process.
- Begin comparting implementation and results.
