Playing with fundamental ML algorithms from scratch on some data sets.

TODO
- Move KNN/NaiveBayes experiments to GitHub. UCI Glass data set.
- Move regression/feature selection/polynomial expansion experiments to GitHub. UCI housing data set.
- Move bias variance tradeoff experiments to GitHub.
- Move KMeans and EM clustering experiments to GitHub.
