# ml-sandbox
Playing with fundamental ML algorithms from scratch on some data sets.

Must have `python 2.7.x` and `numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib` installed to run code in these directories.

TODO
- Move regression/feature selection/polynomial expansion experiments to GitHub. UCI housing data set.
- Move bias variance tradeoff experiments to GitHub.
- Move KMeans and EM clustering experiments to GitHub.
