***Bias Variance Tradeoff***

The goal of the code I am playing around with here is to explore the bias variance tradeoff experimentally, and to see how they contribute to the MSE of a linear regression model for a particular learning problem. Additionally, we look at how the tradeoff is affected by having more data (getting access to more samples for the learning problem).

I sample some number of points from 2x^2 + (gaussian noise), then try to fit regressions models of degree 0, 1, ... 5.

Images for how the bias and variance components of MSE contribute with varying numebr of samples and variance function complexity are generated by the code here and placed in the images folder.

Worth saying: with higher degree regression models, we increase the model complexity and thus expect bias to decrease and variance to increase. We see this in the experimental data.
